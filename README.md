# Pokémon Card Creator

Creating this Web App has been a idea of mine for a while now. I came up with the idea when I was taking a class learning JavaScript and had the basic outline and idea for the project but didn't have the time or talent to finish it. Now that I have learned a lot more in the past few years and I wanted to test my skills and develope a working prototype that I can further develope.

This web app is pretty simple when looking at it from a user perspective, but looking a little deeper, it has a little more complexity built into it. This web app is a Pokémon card creator. You type in the Pokémon that you would like a card made for and it will then populate the card below.
To start the program, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). With that you will then need to clone this repository, and then have to run a few commands to get everything set up. 
This website has some useful tips on creating a Web App, but could also be useful starting a test server [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/).

The purpose for writing this software was more of a challenge for myself to see what I could accomplish with what I at this point in my life. I also am a huge fan of Pokémon and love the card game as well as the video games! I thought it would be fun to mix two of my favorite things together and see what happens! I have other plans that I want to incorporate into this project including deck building, more customization with the cards, and possibly even battles with the cards! I will have to save those for a future project and time.

# Web Pages

I currently only have one web page for this but am looking to add more when I have more time available. As of now, this project doesn't really require more than a single page to run correctly, but again, I am looking to add more in the future.

* Add more cards and be able to create different decks.
* Make the cards more customizable and work better with the different abilities and moves that each Pokémon has.
